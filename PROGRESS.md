## Active

- W-206 typed Rust client, credential handling, and retry semantics.

## Ready

- W-207 Slice 2 reliability gate is ready after W-206.

## Gate evidence

- Windows local formatting: passed
- Windows local lint: passed
- Windows local tests: passed
- GitHub Actions matrix: passed on Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Next coordinator action

Implement W-206 typed Rust client, independently review it, and capture cross-platform CI evidence.
